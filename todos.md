### Feature extraction
[x] surface area
[x] compactness (with respect to a sphere) IS STILL WRONG!!! Must be at most 1!
[x] axis-aligned bounding-box volume
[x] diameter
[x] eccentricity
[x] A3: angle between 3 random vertices
[x] D1: distance between barycenter and random vertex
[x] D2: distance between 2 random vertices
[x] D3: square root of area of triangle given by 3 random vertices
[x] D4: cube root of volume of tetrahedron formed by 4 random vertices

### Personal tasks
[] Parallelize normalisation operation 
[] Histograms for before and after normalisation
[] Implement rest of the features on the slide (Rectangularity, Mesh_Volume (with convex hull), Gravity Point???, Reflective Symmetry, Morphological features)


### Clean Up tasks (For the end)
[] Read all the technical tips again
[] Streamline the formulas in the paper
[] Proof read the paper
[] Rerun the full process
[] Add all package references
[] Streamline cells/faces and point/vertex usage
